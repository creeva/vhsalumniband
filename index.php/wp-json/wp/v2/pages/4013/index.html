He was born November 1, 1871 in Illinois. Mr. Ackley came from a musical family, and took up the cornet at 12. He studied with Carl Kaltenborn of New York who had been the solo cornetist with Gilmore\u2019s famous band for 12 years. At one time, Mr. Ackley enjoyed the reputation of being one of the best B flat cornetists in the country.<\/p> <p>Mr. Ackley traveled the continent with different groups. He spent a season with the Hattie Bernard Chase Company, a season with the Great Eastern Show, and a season with the Floyd Concert Company. He spent a season in Omaha, Nebraska with the Farnham Street Theater, as well as a season in Youngstown at the Grand opera House. When he came to Sandusky he spent several seasons at the Nielson Opera House.<\/p> <p>As a young man, he worked for the Gorman Minstrel Show and traveled all over the country and covered all 38 states in the union at that time. Fred Baumann, of the Great Western Band, heard Mr. Ackley perform and brought him to Sandusky. The Great Western Band had been founded by Charles Baetz (a future general manager at Cedar Point). The band had performed daily for concerts and dances at Cedar Point. Unfortunately the band broke up shortly after Mr. Ackley arrived in the 1890s. He then created his own band. In 1893 he was the director of music at Cedar Point. He wrote the Cedar Point March in 1902, the first piece of music dedicated to the resort.<\/p> <p>While he was a working at Cedar Point, Ackley organized and conducted the Sandusky Band and Orchestra founding the musical program for that area. Eventually, as he moved into playing and conducting other groups, he would return as guest conductor and performed the duty of the music librarian doing a full organization of the large collection of sheet music owned by the group. <\/p> <p>In 1898, Eugene Ackley joined Professor Leon\u2019s Military Band of Toledo and took part in the inaugural exercises of the second term governor Asa Bushnell in Columbus. During his time in the Toledo area he also conducted the Zenobia Shrine band. <\/p> <p>Around 1910 Mr. Ackley was involved with the Vermilion School System as director of the <a href=\"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/alumni\/index.php\/vermilion-high-school-orchestra\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"4656\">Vermilion High School Orchestra<\/a>.

At the time of his death on September 1, 1957, he was the chairman of the board of the Western Security Bank, chairman of the Good Samaritan Hospital building fund, director of the Erie County Ohio Automobile Club, and a member of many community organizations such as the Masons, Shriners, Elks, Eagles and Odd Fellows.
