It&#8217;s this kind of pageantry showing off Vermilion&#8217;s very own colors, that helps the corps enhance the band&#8217;s performance,&#8221; says Fiedler.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Lisa established a Vermilion flag corps in the early 1980&#8217;s, then went on to work with corps in North Royalton, Lakewood and Medina. Last season a group of five flags returned to the Vermilion field and this year thathas doubled to ten. Sailorway Middle School has consistently had a flag program to accompany its marching band and last fall had 55 students audition to be part of the squad. All but two of the current Sailor Marching Band flag corps members began their participation with the group while in middle school.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>When she was a student at Bowling Green State University, Lisa was a horn player in the band. After college graduation she found herself missing band a great deal. &#8220;Since I wasn&#8217;t a music major, I had to find a new way &#8212; something really different &#8211;to become involved  with marching band again. I went to one Saturday workshop about how to start a flag corps and I was ready to roll. When I look back at it now, it was a pretty gutsy thing to do &#8212; but I was young and nothing was going to stop me from being part of the excitement of marching band again.&#8221;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Her enthusiasm carries over to her students who execute their flag maneuvers with pride. Says Fiedler, &#8220;One of my group is actively looking for a college with a Flag Corp. Flags provide another avenue of involvement.

That dream was realized, and now, in my role as the advisor the dream continues.&#8221;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dawn received early baton tips from both Pam Mangus and Becky Nickol, but it was Judy Clark, Dawn&#8217;s sister-in-law and former head majorette who fine-tuned her technique. &#8220;Judy was like a drill sergeant. If I wasn&#8217;t getting it right, Judy was tough on me. She taught me the importance of precision and accuracy.&#8221;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Being the object of watchful eyes and high expectations was the norm for Dawn, not only as a majorette but as a trumpet in the band during both middle and high school. &#8220;I never had a band director except for my father. Because I was his daughter, he was tougher on me and my brother than on anyone else. We had to be the ones to do it right.&#8221;<\/em><br><br><em>This tradition of toughness has followed through in Dawn&#8217;s own instructional style. &#8220;It&#8217;s my goal to have all of the girls in the squad as mirror images of each other. I stop our practice and show tapes to make sure that each hand is at the same level, and each knee raised to the same height. When we&#8217;re out on<br>that field we are not individuals. We are a squad&#8230;and as a squad, we are part of the bigger band&#8230;the bigger picture.&#8221;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>The Sailor Band majorettes begin working in the beginning of July, logging at least 30 hours of practice before the band begins to drill in August. In addition, Dawn meets with the middle school majorettes once a week throughout July and August. There is a very big carryover from working with the majorette squad in middle school to following through the high school program. <\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dawn&#8217;s majorette skills extend beyond the advisory capacity each fall when the Vermilion High School Alumni Band prepares its show for the annual festival. Although she helps teach the drill to returning twirlers, she also picks up the baton herself to take the field. She has marched with the group since its inception&#8211;all but one season&#8211;when her son was born three days prior to the show!<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>When asked how she came to be involved as the majorette advisor, Dawn replied, &#8220;I started it all as a favor to my dad&#8230;.and then somehow I never gave it up. I guess I just love doing it!&#8221;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dawn is the daughter of Dave and Judy Henry, wife of Rick Clark, and mother of Ashley and Branden Clark. <\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/alumni\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/File2424_4322555461_o-806x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3476\" width=\"836\" height=\"1062\" srcset=\"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/alumni\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/File2424_4322555461_o-806x1024.jpg 806w, http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/alumni\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/File2424_4322555461_o-236x300.jpg 236w, http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/alumni\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/File2424_4322555461_o-768x975.jpg 768w, http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/alumni\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/File2424_4322555461_o-1209x1536.jpg 1209w, http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/alumni\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/File2424_4322555461_o-300x381.jpg 300w, http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/alumni\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/File2424_4322555461_o-850x1080.jpg 850w, http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/alumni\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/File2424_4322555461_o.jpg 1566w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 836px) 100vw, 836px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:25px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Emery is band assistant director<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>A familiar Vermilionite, Bobbi Emery, has joined the staff of the Sailor Marching Band for this fall&#8217;s season as assistant to the band&#8217;s director, Joseph Price.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>A graduate of Vermilion High School in 1976, Bobbi returns to her hometown with a wide array of experience.

Bill Burt was my high school director and Joe and I have a long association of not only playing together but playing for each other in our musicals &#8212; me in Vermilion and he at LCMT.
