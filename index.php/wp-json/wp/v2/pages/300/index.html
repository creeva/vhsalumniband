This year we were 69 members strong. There were 9 majorettes and 59 musicians. <\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>The band attended every football game plus some festivals and parades. There were some new festivals: On September 19 we attended the Dover festival, October 4 we went to the Sandusky festival. The Lakewood festival was on October 10. We hosted our own on September 26. We had new experiences when it came to parades: In October we went to the Millersburg parade and won first place. For the first time, we were invited to march in the TV8 Christmas parade in Cleveland. We also hosted the Fish Festival and Woolbear parades. <\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>On November 10 we had our band banquet. The program started with a performance by the Jazz Band. Then we were served our dinner by the Sailorway Middle School Band. After dinner, the awards were distributed. When it was the Senior&#8217;s turn they got to read their wills. Some wills were very moving and some were just plain funny. The way some people felt about the season were similar. Cyndi Foster felt, &#8220;The season was great! Even though we were a lot smaller, everyone still enjoyed it!&#8221; Michelle Hazlett said, &#8220;It was a good experience.&#8221;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>For the Seniors, the year of Marching Band is over. The memories we will cherish forever! We will be looking forward to seeing next year&#8217;s Marching Band. We are all proud to be a part of it.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:50px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><a href=\"https://vhsalumniband.org/\">Vermilion Bands<\/a>&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;<a href=\"https://vhsalumniband.org/index.php\/vermilion-bands\/highschool\/\">Vermilion Sailor Marching Bands<\/a>&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;<a href=\"https://vhsalumniband.org/index.php\/vermilion-bands\/highschool\/1980-1989\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"248\">1980-1989 Vermilion Sailor Marching Bands<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:50px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>1987-1988 Vermilion Sailor Marching Band Director: David Henry Image Galleries: Video Playlists: And now hear this&#8230; by Robbie Jones &#8220;Now hear this!&#8221;, is the introduction to the Sailor Marching Band halftime show.
