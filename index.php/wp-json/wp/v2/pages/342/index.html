The field director and head majorette is Miss Susan Fultz.&#8221;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>At every varsity football game you can count on hearing an announcement similar to this one and on seeing a band show that has had a lot of hard work put into it. <\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Out band immediately gains attention with its dignified Anchors Aweigh Fanfare and sharp precision drilling that is different from any other band&#8217;s in the area. Its drills are mainly &#8220;company front&#8221; Cassavant style that have been adapted by Mr. Burt, and it&#8217;s the style of drilling that gives Vermilion such distinction. At the end of every show the Band leaves the field with a flourish and the Anchors Aweigh Fanfare. <\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Only aft seeing such a band show can you appreciate how much work has gone into it. The members began work on their shows six weeks before school started, around August the first, by coming to band every morning for four weeks just to work on music. Then two weeks before school started the band practiced on the football field every morning and every evening on drills, maneuvers, and steps with and without music. It was then that the 1966 Sailors developed a regular audience. <\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>It was also then that they heard the first complaints that they weren&#8217;t quite what they used to be, but there was good reason for that. On-third of the band had never marched on the football field due to the three-year band system. But in spite of this slow start the general opinion, and that of Mr. Burt, is that the 1966 Sailors compare favorably with our past bands.  The crowds have always enjoyed our style of marching; our solid sound, well-arranged music and authority on the field. It was this popularity that won the Sailors invitations to Oberlin, Massilon, and Wellington Band Festivals, and the Brown&#8217;s stadium, the Cleveland Arena, and won them the right to be one of the two bands to represent Ohio in the International Lions Club Convention&#8217;s Parade in 1964. The trophies from these and other events are now on display in the trophy case at the South Decatur Street entrance.  But even with all of this background, a band can only be as good as its directors, and Vermilion is lucky to have of the greatest, Mr. Burt and Mr. Henry. Mr. Burts influence on the band since he joined us in 1955 has really been remarkable and has proven the truth of this statement. Mr. Henry has only been with us since 1965 and he is already leaving his mark on our Sailors. <\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>The band is not through for the year with the last football game, because the band&#8217;s duties aren&#8217;t limited to the football field.  The band is looking forward to basketball season when they provide a pep band. the Halloween Parade October 27th, the Memorial Day Parade, the Band Banquet given by the Music Boosters on November 22nd, and the concert season with the Winter Concert February 4th and the Spring Concert May 12th. <\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>So let&#8217;s stay around during half-time, watch the band show and show them how much they&#8217;re appreciated. <\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:25px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1013\" src=\"https://vhsalumniband.org/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/1966-1967-2019-07-23-10.46.49-1024x1013.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3080\" srcset=\"https://vhsalumniband.org/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/1966-1967-2019-07-23-10.46.49-1024x1013.jpg 1024w, https://vhsalumniband.org/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/1966-1967-2019-07-23-10.46.49-300x297.jpg 300w, https://vhsalumniband.org/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/1966-1967-2019-07-23-10.46.49-768x760.jpg 768w, https://vhsalumniband.org/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/1966-1967-2019-07-23-10.46.49-1536x1519.jpg 1536w, https://vhsalumniband.org/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/1966-1967-2019-07-23-10.46.49-2048x2026.jpg 2048w, https://vhsalumniband.org/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/1966-1967-2019-07-23-10.46.49-850x841.jpg 850w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:25px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A Farewell Salute<\/strong> by Lola Hall<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>The show was over and there they were: thirty Seniors (playing with the other band members) their school Alma Mater in front of their favorite fans.  In those few moments, the feelings felt from years swept through their minds, as they there wearing their Sailor uniform for the last time. <\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Many may not think this such a sad moment, but when you march off that field, you suddenly realize you&#8217;ve marched your final half-time show. <\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>The Senior members of this year&#8217;s (1966-1967) marching band felt, along with me, just that way. It&#8217;s a moment that&#8217;s past and can&#8217;t be repeated. Four years of marching half-time shows and Band festivals are ended in a solemn salute of playing the school Alma Mater. <\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>But it&#8217;s not all sadness, for these Seniors will take memories of fun and hard work with them. <\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Taking a looking into the past will find that this class is probably the most fortunate. This years&#8217; Seniors were the last class to begin their band years in the fourth grade. They also were the last Freshmean Class to march in the varsity band. They will be the last of those who made the Toronto Trip and to wear the &#8220;ole&#8221; style band hat (This many of them to keep??)<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Of these thirty band members graduating, four of them will be leaving the majorette squad.  All but one of the girls has been in band since Jr. High, but the feeling is the same.  For these girls and the marching band, it&#8217;s over.  The next step will be Memorial Day, but to the thirty Seniors it won&#8217;t be the same as the feeling experienced last Friday Night as they on their home field playing the Alma Mater.<\/em> <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Those also leaving will be our two band managers, Cynthia Foster and Tom Maurer, who worked hard to see that everything needed for marching season was there and ready.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Those Seniors who marched for the last time last Friday are: Maria Agen, Nancy Ayars, Sue Bachman, Gary Dropko, Robert Deval, Susan Fultz (Head Majorette), Bonnie Greenwood, Lola Hall, Peter Hart, Kevin Horn, Marcha Idol (marjorette), Diane Jeffery, Dennis Johnson, Roberta Johnson, Penny Kishman, Don McClimmans, Jill Mikola, David Moes, John Neff, Paul (Stu) Naegle, Jean Pratt (majorette), Pat Prieur, Susan Reiber, Keith Seibert, Trudy Tische, Ellen Trinter, Barb Warner, Debbie Zerad, and Dana Forcum (majorette). <\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:25px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://vhsalumniband.org/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/1966-1967-2019-07-23-10.46.56-434x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3081\" width=\"841\" height=\"1984\" srcset=\"https://vhsalumniband.org/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/1966-1967-2019-07-23-10.46.56-434x1024.jpg 434w, https://vhsalumniband.org/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/1966-1967-2019-07-23-10.46.56-127x300.jpg 127w, https://vhsalumniband.org/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/1966-1967-2019-07-23-10.46.56-768x1811.jpg 768w, https://vhsalumniband.org/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/1966-1967-2019-07-23-10.46.56-651x1536.jpg 651w, https://vhsalumniband.org/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/1966-1967-2019-07-23-10.46.56-868x2048.jpg 868w, https://vhsalumniband.org/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/1966-1967-2019-07-23-10.46.56-300x707.jpg 300w, https://vhsalumniband.org/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/1966-1967-2019-07-23-10.46.56-850x2005.jpg 850w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 841px) 100vw, 841px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:25px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Band Banquet<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>The banquet honoring the Marching Band was held Tuesday, November 22, in the high school cafeteria with the Marching Band and their parents in attendance.
