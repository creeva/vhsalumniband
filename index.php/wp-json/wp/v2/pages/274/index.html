As part of his musical education, his cornet instructor was Forest Buchtel, a musician of much renown. Serving under Mr. Burt, it was Mr. Henry&#8217;s leadership in starting the Vermilion Band Boosters program, which still continues today.   As an assistant, Mr. Henry helped organize the first Vermilion Marching Band Festival and gained knowledge of strength and tradition from Mr. Burt.  In the 1980 school year, after Mr. Burt&#8217;s retirement, Mr. Henry became the Band Director of the Vermilion Sailor Marching Band. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mr. Henry brought in the first Flag Corp to the marching band, founded the Vermilion Jazz Band, and the Soundsations Show Band, and was the first director to lead the band in the annual Vermilion Woolybear festival.  One of his passions was the annual high school musical, serving as director of the musicals for decades while Assistant Director and later Director of the Vermilion Bands. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mr. Henry&#8217;s students learned quickly that when listening to instructions to &#8220;Do what he meant and not what he said.&#8221;  They also knew as they crowded to the band room that the rule was &#8220;Everyone in before anyone out.&#8221; Mr. Henry retired in 1994 being an inspiration to his students.  He continued on as Music director of the Grace United Methodist Church in Vermilion, OH. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mr. Henry, unfortunately, passed away in 2017. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:25px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/alumni\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/1993-1994vhsmb060.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3428\" width=\"839\" height=\"640\" srcset=\"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/alumni\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/1993-1994vhsmb060.png 828w, http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/alumni\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/1993-1994vhsmb060-300x229.png 300w, http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/alumni\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/1993-1994vhsmb060-768x586.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 839px) 100vw, 839px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:25px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Marching Band &#8211; A Super Sailor&#8217;s Swan Song by Brent Gueth<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>While many may claim that they &#8220;Save the Best for Last,&#8221; the claim is true in the case of Sailor Band Director, Dave Henry.

Sailor Jazz, the Vermilion Band Festival, the creation of Band Boosters, and participation in the Woolybear Festival all started under his lead. <\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>The strength of the program perhaps came from the loyalty band students felt towards Mr. Henry. Many participated all four years, and many families had two or three siblings involved in the program.
