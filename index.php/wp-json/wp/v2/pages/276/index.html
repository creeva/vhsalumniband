It could be considered the golden age (so far) of the band.  Regardless of what someone refers to it as Mr. Burt built the underpinnings of the Vermilion Band Program.  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mr. Burt was a graduate of Bowling Green State University and had a master&#8217;s degree from VanderCook College of Music, Chicago. He arrived in Vermilion as the Band Director in 1956, filling in the vacancy left behind by <a href=\"https://vhsalumniband.org/index.php\/vermilion-high-school-band-directors\/vermilion-high-school-band-directors\/james-hoffman\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"732\">James Hoffman<\/a>. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mr. Burt was the person that shaped the military marching style that existed in the Vermilion Sailor Marching Band for decades. The majorette outfits were changed to a version similar to the ones still used today in 1957.  The long-term classic Vermilion uniforms arrived in 1962. In the 1959 school year, the band under his direction cut their first (and only) record.  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mr. Burt believed three things are what was needed for a band of his caliber:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Be at the right place, at the right time, with the right equipment, in the right frame of mind <\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>March with the feeling of rhythm<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Espirit de corp<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>The story goes that the during a gathering with former students at Mr. Burt&#8217;s house on a summer evening, the discussion came up of creating an Alumni Band.  He figured they still had enough spirit in them to &#8220;Do It One More Time.&#8221; In 1986, under his direction, the first Vermilion Sailor Alumni took the field. An organization that still continues to this day. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mr. Burt, unfortunately, passed away in 2010.  He will always be remembered for his contributions.  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:25px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://vhsalumniband.org/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/1979-retire.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3287\" width=\"838\" height=\"1327\" srcset=\"https://vhsalumniband.org/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/1979-retire.png 408w, https://vhsalumniband.org/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/1979-retire-189x300.png 189w, https://vhsalumniband.org/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/1979-retire-300x475.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 838px) 100vw, 838px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:25px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>After 24 Years Band Director Willie B.
