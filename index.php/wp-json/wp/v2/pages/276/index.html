Regardless of what someone refers to it as Mr. Burt built the underpinnings of the Vermilion Band Program. <\/p> <p>Mr. Burt was a graduate of Bowling Green State University and had a master&#8217;s degree from VanderCook College of Music, Chicago. He arrived in Vermilion as the Band Director in 1956, filling in the vacancy left behind by <a href=\"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/alumni\/index.php\/vermilion-high-school-band-directors\/vermilion-high-school-band-directors\/james-hoffman\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"732\">James Hoffman<\/a>. <\/p> <p>Mr. Burt was the person that shaped the military marching style that existed in the Vermilion Sailor Marching Band for decades. The majorette outfits were changed to a version similar to the ones still used today in 1957. The long-term classic Vermilion uniforms arrived in 1962. In the 1959 school year, the band under his direction cut their first (and only) record. <\/p> <p>Mr. Burt believed three things are what was needed for a band of his caliber:<\/p> <ol>\n<li>Be at the right place, at the right time, with the right equipment, in the right frame of mind <\/li> <li>March with the feeling of rhythm<\/li> <li>Espirit de corp<\/li>\n<\/ol> <p>The story goes that the during a gathering with former students at Mr. Burt&#8217;s house on a summer evening, the discussion came up of creating an Alumni Band. He figured they still had enough spirit in them to &#8220;Do It One More Time.&#8221; In 1986, under his direction, the first Vermilion Sailor Alumni took the field. An organization that still continues to this day. <\/p> <p>Mr. Burt, unfortunately, passed away in 2010. He will always be remembered for his contributions. <\/p> <div style=\"height:25px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div> <figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/alumni\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/1979-retire.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3287\" style=\"width:838px\" width=\"838\"\/><\/figure> <div style=\"height:25px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div> <p><strong><em>After 24 Years Band Director Willie B.
