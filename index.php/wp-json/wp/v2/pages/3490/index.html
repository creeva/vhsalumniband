That dream was realized, and now, in my role as the advisor the dream continues.&#8221;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dawn received early baton tips from both Pam Mangus and Becky Nickol, but it was Judy Clark, Dawn&#8217;s sister-in-law and former head majorette who fine-tuned her technique. &#8220;Judy was like a drill sergeant. If I wasn&#8217;t getting it right, Judy was tough on me. She taught me the importance of precision and accuracy.&#8221;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Being the object of watchful eyes and high expectations was the norm for Dawn, not only as a majorette but as a trumpet in the band during both middle and high school. &#8220;I never had a band director except for my father. Because I was his daughter, he was tougher on me and my brother than on anyone else. We had to be the ones to do it right.&#8221;<\/em><br><br><em>This tradition of toughness has followed through in Dawn&#8217;s own instructional style. &#8220;It&#8217;s my goal to have all of the girls in the squad as mirror images of each other. I stop our practice and show tapes to make sure that each hand is at the same level, and each knee raised to the same height. When we&#8217;re out on<br>that field we are not individuals. We are a squad&#8230;and as a squad, we are part of the bigger band&#8230;the bigger picture.&#8221;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>The Sailor Band majorettes begin working in the beginning of July, logging at least 30 hours of practice before the band begins to drill in August. In addition, Dawn meets with the middle school majorettes once a week throughout July and August. There is a very big carryover from working with the majorette squad in middle school to following through the high school program. <\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dawn&#8217;s majorette skills extend beyond the advisory capacity each fall when the Vermilion High School Alumni Band prepares its show for the annual festival. Although she helps teach the drill to returning twirlers, she also picks up the baton herself to take the field. She has marched with the group since its inception&#8211;all but one season&#8211;when her son was born three days prior to the show!<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>When asked how she came to be involved as the majorette advisor, Dawn replied, &#8220;I started it all as a favor to my dad&#8230;.and then somehow I never gave it up. I guess I just love doing it!&#8221;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dawn is the daughter of Dave and Judy Henry, wife of Rick Clark, and mother of Ashley and Branden Clark. <\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/alumni\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/File2424_4322555461_o-806x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3476\" width=\"836\" height=\"1062\" srcset=\"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/alumni\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/File2424_4322555461_o-806x1024.jpg 806w, http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/alumni\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/File2424_4322555461_o-236x300.jpg 236w, http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/alumni\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/File2424_4322555461_o-768x975.jpg 768w, http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/alumni\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/File2424_4322555461_o-1209x1536.jpg 1209w, http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/alumni\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/File2424_4322555461_o-300x381.jpg 300w, http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/alumni\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/File2424_4322555461_o-850x1080.jpg 850w, http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/alumni\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/File2424_4322555461_o.jpg 1566w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 836px) 100vw, 836px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:25px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Emery is band assistant director<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>A familiar Vermilionite, Bobbi Emery, has joined the staff of the Sailor Marching Band for this fall&#8217;s season as assistant to the band&#8217;s director, Joseph Price.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>A graduate of Vermilion High School in 1976, Bobbi returns to her hometown with a wide array of experience. Currently, she teaches beginning instrumentalists in the Clearview District and also works with students grades 1-5 in general music. In addition to her full-time job, last year Bobbi ran the marching, concert, jazz, and pep bands for Southview High School in Lorain. Previously she was assistant band director at both Southview and Clearview and ran the instrumental music program at Lorain Catholic for two years. During her senior year of college at Ashland University, she wrote and taught all the drills for the college band.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>In the midst of all this, Bobbi has found time to be the Orchestral Director for Lorain Community Music Theater for the past decade, often being the one consistent link as production crews changed from year to year. She also plays in the Lorain Community College Band.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Bobbi has maintained strong roots in Vermilion, having played in the Vermilion Alumni Band since its inception. She began playing her trumpet in the pit for the Vermilion High School musicals when she was a student here and is invited back every year by orchestral director, Price.  &#8220;Dave Henry started me on my instrument.  Bill Burt was my high school director and Joe and I have a long association of not only playing together but playing for each other in our musicals &#8212; me in Vermilion and he at LCMT. I&#8217;m really excited to be working with Joe as part of the Sailor Marching Band again.&#8221;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Her first day of band practice this August provided not only a trip down memory lane but also a realization. &#8220;Over the years I&#8217;ve worked with students in other districts, but have been distanced from young people in Vermilion. When I came to practice what I saw the same as every place else &#8212; a bunch of great kids having a lot of fun with band.  That&#8217;s what makes being involved with music so exciting.&#8221;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Bobbi is the daughter of Jerry and Nancy Emery of Vermilion. <\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:50px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><a href=\"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/alumni\/\">Vermilion Bands<\/a>&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/alumni\/index.php\/vermilion-bands\/highschool\/\">Vermilion Sailor Alumni Ma<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/alumni\/index.php\/vermilion-bands\/alumni\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"2693\">rching Bands<\/a> &#8211; <a href=\"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/alumni\/index.php\/vermilion-bands\/alumni\/1990-1999-vermilion-sailor-alumni-bands\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"2803\">1990-1999 Vermilion Sailor Alumni Band<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:50px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>1995 Vermilion Sailor Alumni Band Director: William Burt Video Playlists: Woolybear Band Festival is Sept. 30 When Woollybears come to Vermilion, so do marching bands, and this year is no exception.
