The festival that the students enjoyed the most was Massillon on September 21, because it was the best performance and also it was the peak of their season. On September 26 the marching band marched in the Vermilioln&#8217;s Woolybear Pfolowing their own festival MC&#8217;d by Dick Goddard the evening before. For these performances, Anthony Wayne was their overnight guest. The other festivals were Amherst on October 5, Sandusky on October 6, and Lorain on October 26. Some favorite sons for the band were &#8220;Barbara Ann&#8221; and &#8220;Raiders of the Lost Ark.&#8221;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>An important part of the senior band members&#8217; year was dedicating their senior show, the first show of the season, and the Vermilion marching band festival to their classmate Tommy Perkins. Tommy was killed in the summer of 1984. He was very special to the senior band members of 1985-1986.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:50px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><a href=\"https://vhsalumniband.org/\">Vermilion Bands<\/a>&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;<a href=\"https://vhsalumniband.org/index.php\/vermilion-bands\/highschool\/\">Vermilion Sailor Marching Bands<\/a>&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;<a href=\"https://vhsalumniband.org/index.php\/vermilion-bands\/highschool\/1980-1989\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"248\">1980-1989 Vermilion Sailor Marching Bands<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:50px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>1985-1986 Vermilion Sailor Marching Band Director: David Henry Image Galleries: Video Playlists: Season Sparkles The marching band had a great season with only one rainstorm and one very cold Wellington game.
