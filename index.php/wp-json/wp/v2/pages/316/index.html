The Oberlin College Football Game proved to be the change for the marching band to show off their new style. The Marching Band also participated in the Sandusky, Massilon, and Copley band festivals. They were also in the &#8220;Anthony Wayne Showcase of Bands.&#8221; Our own festival was held indoors due to heavy rains. <\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>The Majorettes improved their style during their week stay at the Smith Walbridge Camp for majorettes where they took first place in their division. The band improved under the new band directors who enforced a stricter policy of discipline. Part of the new style was to change the show every week so that routines were not repeated. On the field, the hours of practice paid off in a marked improvement in sound as well as marching performance. <\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Unfortunately, it poured on the day of our festival. The Bands were moved inside for a truly unique show. The show included the Ida, Michigan Blue Streak Marching Band. Also performing were the Norwalk St. Paul and Arcadia bands. <\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>The 1979 Marching Band Season was brought to a close with the annual Band Banquet given by the Band Boosters. <\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Seniors Tracey Anderson, Jay Sopko, Judy Clark, and Mike Nickley were given the outstanding senior awards. The Freshmen were given certificates enabling them to buy their letter jackets or sweaters.  Sophomores were awarded their band letters, Juniors were given pins, and Seniors were given their Marching Band pictures. <\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:50px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><a href=\"https://vhsalumniband.org/\">Vermilion Bands<\/a>\u00a0\u2013\u00a0<a href=\"https://vhsalumniband.org/index.php\/vermilion-bands\/highschool\/\">Vermilion Sailor Marching Bands<\/a>\u00a0\u2013\u00a0<a href=\"https://vhsalumniband.org/index.php\/vermilion-bands\/highschool\/1980-1989\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"248\">1980-1989 Vermilion Sailor Marching Bands<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:50px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>1979-1980 Vermilion Sailor Marching Band Director: David Henry Image Galleries: Band Changes Style Under New Direction The Marching Band underwent major changes with the new direction Mr. David Henry and the new assistants Mr. John Murhpy and Mr. Joeseph Price.
