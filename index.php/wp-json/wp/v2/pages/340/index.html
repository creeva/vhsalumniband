Vermilion&#8217;s &#8220;company front&#8221; style (marching in one long line instead of a solid block) and military routines require much practice and drilling, as well as a good deal of planning on paper before they can even be tried on the field. All of the music has to be memorized and the drills learned. They are fitted together re-arranged and edited several times, practiced over and over again, and finally put on display on Friday night. <\/em><\/p> <p><em>This year the band has had difficulty in practicing because there is no football field yet at the new school. On afternoons when the weather is good the band is transported by school buses to the Junior High, where they stay and practice until 3:30 or 4:00.<\/em><\/p> <p><em>The majorettes, a vital part of the band, attend Summer camps as well as all of the regular practice sessions. Each week they are featured in a routine that they have to work pretty hard to get ready. Their efforts are greatly appreciated by the band, as well as the fans. The band would also like to thank the cheerleaders for their support. <\/em><\/p> <p><em>The next two weeks are going to be the busiest ones of the football season for the band members. October 4 is the night of the game with Oberlin, Vermilion&#8217;s rival for the No. 1 band of the conference. On October 5, Vermilion&#8217;s Sailors have been invited to attend the Annual Oberlin Band Festival. On Oct. 6 the band is scheduled to play for the dedication of the new high school. Then the following weekend, the game on Fri. is with New London and Saturday is the first Bellevue Band Festival in Bellevue, Ohio. <\/em><\/p> <p><em>The band&#8217;s activities by no means end with the termination of football season. Concert band then follows with Winter and Spring. Concerts and the Lakeland Conference Band Festival. The pep band also adds much spirit to the basketball games. In the late spring, the band changes back to marching again to get ready for the Memorial Day and the Festival of the Fish Parades. <\/em><\/p> <p><em>A good band requires planning, time, patience, and spirit. But before any marching unit can develop any of these qualities, it must have a good director. Vermilion is very fortunate to have one of the best of all, Mr. Burt. Mr. Henry, who acts as Mr. Burt&#8217;s assistant, is also a great help in a band the size of Vermilion&#8217;s. <\/em><\/p> <p><em>A good band is made up of individuals who must: 1: &#8220;Be at the right place, at the right time, with the right equipment, in the right frame of mind&#8221;; 2. &#8220;March with the feeling of good rhythm!&#8221;; and 3. have &#8220;Espirit de corps!&#8221; Vermilion&#8217;s Sailor Marching Band has all of these qualities, stick around during the half-time and see what they can do with them. <\/em><\/p> <div style=\"height:25px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div> <figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/alumni\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/1967-1968-2019-07-23-10.53.39.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3155\"\/><\/figure> <div style=\"height:25px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div> <p><strong>Nostalgia Strikes Senior Band<\/strong><\/p> <p><em>Last Friday was the last football game of the season for all the students at VHS. But for the Senior band members, it also meant they had performed in their final half-time show. <\/em><\/p> <p><em>Many of them regarded this with mixed emotions. Of course, the last show meant no more sessions on the cold, windy, sometimes muddy practice field, no more cold, wet feet or nervous stomachs on Friday nights, no more lining up for the show and then wishing you had taken the time for a short trip to the restroom, no more fighting over the &#8220;dead chickens&#8221;, and so on. But, after three years of marching, it also meant, no more applause from the appreciative crowd when you know you have done your best to give a good performance, no more &#8220;thumbs up&#8221; praise from Mr. Burt, no more pep talks, no more meeting kids in other bands, no more &#8220;which school can play the loudest&#8221; jam session at the band festivals, and more experiences that none of them will ever forget. <\/em><\/p> <p><em>All the Senior Sailors in the marching band would like to express their appreciation to Mr. Burt for demonstrating a remarkable amount of patience when they were in the wrong place at the wrong time with the wrong equipment (if they had any equipment at all) in the wrong frame of mind. They would like to thank Mr. Henry, the bus drivers, the Music Booster, and the school officials for their help, cooperation, support, and understanding. <\/em><\/p> <p><em>Last Friday the Senior band members received corsages and boutonnieres from the Music Boosters. They say thanks again to them. Then Friday evening, the half-time show the senior musicians in &#8220;The Stripper&#8221;.<\/em><\/p> <p><em>Although they will have the opportunity to march again next spring for the Memorial Day and Fish Festival Parades, it just won&#8217;t be the same as a football show.

Saxophone: Ellen Brown, and Glenn Duncan. Clarinets: JoAnn West, Amber Poizin, Judy Smarr, and Lynette Cline. Flutes: Lynn McCullough, and Pat Fillmore. <\/em><\/p> <p><em>These Seniors stuck with it through summer practices, wrong notes, concerts, soggy fields, the bus getting lost, and the joy of the welcoming applause after the grand performance. Yes, these seniors have worthily received the name of the GREAT Vermilion Sailor Marching band. <\/em><\/p> <p><em>Good luck and Best wishes, seniors, in your upcoming &#8220;debut&#8221; with the world.
